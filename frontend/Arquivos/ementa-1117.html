One can say that in the recent years Brazilian politics has taken a<br><br>true rollercoaster ride. Along the first decade of the 21st century Brazil was seen as an emerging<br><br>economy remarkably promising to national and international investors, and also as an<br><br>emerging power steadily moving to join the restricted group of influential nations in the<br><br>world affairs. In the second decade of the 21st century the perceptions about the future of<br><br>Brazil have changed dramatically, and uncertainties became predominant in every aspects of<br><br>the Brazilian politics and economy. The changes in the world economic scenario after the<br><br>2008 financial crisis were important to the Brazilian downswing but much less relevant than<br><br>the many domestic developments in the process of breeding the crisis which ended up in the<br><br>presidential impeachment, and in the harsh economic recession which the country is now<br><br>trying to move out.<br><br>The purpose of this course is to offer a comprehensive discussion of the most relevant<br><br>aspects of recent developments in politics and economy of the country bringing about<br><br>substantial changes in the foreign policy agenda. It will include also discussions on the various<br><br>developments in the agenda of the regional and world politics which will be important to<br><br>countries like Brazil in the near future. Brazil has many problems and difficulties to deal with<br><br>in the years to come, both in the domestic and in the international levels. Brazilian foreign<br><br>policy agenda includes adapting to new patterns of trade, attaining economic and political<br><br>stability, and developing approaches to issues like the climate change and environmental demands,<br><br>and the need for a more effective regional security regime. Globally it is expected that<br><br>Brazil will be more demanded to participate actively in multilateral arrangements as well as in<br><br>cooperation for economic and social development programs. Some of the topics of the<br><br>course will be presented and discussed by UnB faculty members, and by guest speakers with<br><br>expertise in the various subjects of the course.</p></td></tr><tr class="padrao" bgcolor="white"><td valign="top"><b>Programa:</b> </td><td class="PadraoMenor"><p align="justify">CONCEPTS, HISTORY AND THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES<br><br><br><br>The Brazilian Constitution of 1988 and the main institutions of the Brazilian State.<br><br>Brazilian foreign policy overview: changes, continuities, and trends.<br><br>Brazilian foreign policy: institutions and decision making process.<br><br>Brazilian economy: nationalism or integration to world economy?
